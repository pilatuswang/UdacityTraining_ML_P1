-- for Project 1 

Developer: Chen Wang
Date: 6/14/2022
Libraries used in the project: 
numpy   
pandas
matplotlib.pyplot

Project: this is the first project “Write A Data Science Blog Post” for the “Data Scientist Nanodegree” in Udacity training. 

Description: The Jupytor notebook has the codes that helps answer the three questions of interest: if US software engineers have higher salary, higher career satisfaction, and higher job satisfaction. The answer is yes to all three questions based on the descriptive statistic from the data set.

Motivation: this project will get some insights from data survey_results_public_P1 on the welling of the software engineers from the United States and how it is compared to other countries. Three questions are to be answered: 
Question 1: does US software engineers have higher salary compared to the those from other countires? 
Question 2: does US software engineers have higher career satisfaction compared to the those from other countires?
Question 3: does US software engineers have higher career satisfaction compared to the those from other countires?

Files in folder: 
1.	Readme
2.	Jupytor notebook
3.	Data: survey_results_schema_P1

About the Dataset: 
Stack Overflow conducts survey of software engineers, covering various information like salary, career satisfaction, job satisfaction etc. 

Data: 
The data has two files:
1.	survey_results_public_P1.csv 
2.	survey_results_schema_P1.csv 
 

Business Understanding: survey_results_public_P1 is on the welling of the software engineers from the United States also from all other countries in the world. 

This project follows the CRISP Process (also seen in notebook): 
Data Preparation: 
    -- Load data in 
Data Understanding: 
    -- What content do we have in the data? # rows and columns. 
Data Cleansing
    -- Drop na values if necessary
Data Analysis 
    -- Answer the three questions
Data Visualization and Summary
    -- Get the summary and visualization on data 


Summary of Results:

Question 1: does US software engineers have higher salary compared to the those from other countires? 
Analysis with summary to Question 1: Yes, based on the statistics on mean and median salary. 

Question 2: does US software engineers have higher career satisfaction compared to the those from other countires?
Analysis with summary to Question 2: Yes, based on the statistics on mean and median salary.

Question 3: does US software engineers have higher career satisfaction compared to the those from other countires?
Analysis with summary to Question 3: Yes, based on the statistics on mean and median salary.
